## Term Project 6

This project is attempting to classify tweets from different companies such as Tesla, Apple, Wells Fargo, Facebook and Youtube.
The different classes are:
- Positive
- Negative
- Neutral
- Issue

## Data
The training data set was built from a collection of tweets sourced directly from twitter using their API. It was then manually labeled by the team.

## Text mining

We used simple text mining and sentiment analysis techniques to determine compound and granular sentiment scores for all the tweets which is to be used as features for our models.

## Models
